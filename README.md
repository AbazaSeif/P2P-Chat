# P2P-Chat

A chat application that uses peer-to-peer (Hybrid model).  
There are no plans yet for populating this, it was mainly done for practice and fun.

## How to

In order to productively use the application, you need to setup a central server where  
peers are supposed to use to know about eachother.  
You can do that by running the HybridCentralPoint.java in the directory centralpoint.

To run the actual application, compile and execute the file UserInfo.java in directory  
p2pchat.  You should not run P2PChat.java on it's own, that's because UserInfo.java  
executes that class after retreiving user information.  It's quite confusing but I'll  
find a better way to do that in the near future.
